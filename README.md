# Read Together

Use this to compare the `to-read` shelves between you and others with public Goodreads profiles.

## TODO

### Before initial release

- match books
- implement loading state
- style!!!
- change upper limit of books to actual total

### After initial release

- add [abort controller](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)
- allow select/deselect of users
- store query results in database with 24 hour (?) expiry
- abstract the search so users can compare more shelves
- figure out a way to conduct a search by username instead of ID
